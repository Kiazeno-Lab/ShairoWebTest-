# Personal Portfolio

A passionate, elegant, and animated portfolio built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a pinch of JavaScript â€” designed to feel alive while staying clean and accessible.

## Customize
- Replace "Your Name" and text in `index.html` with your details.
- Update social links in the hero section.
- Swap project screenshots and descriptions in the Projects section.
- Set your real email in the Contact section (both the visible email and the `mailto:` action).
- Tweak colors and typography in `styles.css` via CSS variables.

## Run locally
From the `portfolio` folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Markup and sections
- `styles.css`: Theme, layout, and animations
- `script.js`: Scroll reveals, tilt, copy email, dynamic year

## Notes
- Images are from Unsplash as placeholders. Replace with your own.
- The form uses `mailto:` for simplicity. Wire up a backend or service for production.
